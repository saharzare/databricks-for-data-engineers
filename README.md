# 🚀 Databricks for Data Engineers

A minimal guide to essential Databricks concepts for Data Engineers.
- **Data Engineering in Databricks** – refers to the process of building, managing, and optimizing data pipelines for large-scale data processing, transformation, and storage. It enables businesses to efficiently move and process data for analytics and machine learning.
## Why Use Databricks for Data Engineering?
🚀 Scalability – Handles massive datasets with distributed computing.
⚡ Fast Processing – Optimized Spark engine speeds up data operations.
💾 Reliable Storage – Delta Lake ensures data consistency and easy rollback.
🔄 Automated Workflows – Easily schedule and monitor ETL jobs.
## Key Responsibilities of a Data Engineer in Databricks
✅ **Ingest Data** – Load structured and unstructured data from various sources (APIs, databases, files, streaming)

✅ **Transform & Process Data** – Use Apache Spark (PySpark, SQL) to clean, aggregate, and structure data

✅ **Store Data Efficiently** – Utilize Delta Lake for ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel

✅ **Optimize Performance** – Use caching, partitioning, and clustering to improve query speed

✅ **Manage Data Pipelines** – Automate workflows using Databricks Workflows (formerly Jobs)

✅ **Ensure Data Governance & Security** – Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and encryption

## 📌 Topics Covered

- **Databricks Overview** – What it is and why use it
- **Delta Lake** – ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel
- **Querying Data** – SQL vs PySpark in Databricks
- **Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse** – Key differences
- **Best Practices** – Performance tuning, security, and cost management

## 🔥 1. What is Databricks?
Databricks is a cloud-based platform built on **Apache Spark** that allows for scalable data processing, analytics, and machine learning.

- Supports **Python, SQL, Scala, R**
- Optimized for **big data & AI workloads**
- Integrates with **AWS, Azure, and GCP**

## ⚡ 2. Delta Lake – The Smarter Data Lake
Delta Lake improves traditional data lakes by adding reliability and performance.

### 🔹 Key Features:
✅ **ACID Transactions** – Ensures consistency in data updates  
✅ **Time Travel** – Access older versions of data  
✅ **Schema Evolution** – Allows column modifications  
✅ **Performance Boost** – Faster queries with indexing & caching  
**Example Usage (SQL in Databricks):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  event_id STRING,
  event_type STRING
) USING DELTA;
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM events VERSION AS OF 5;
```

## 🛠️ 3. Querying Data in Databricks
Databricks supports both **SQL and PySpark** for querying data.

**SQL Example:**
```sql
SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE age > 25;
```
**PySpark Example:**
```python
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data/customers")
df.filter(df.age > 25).show()
```

## 🏗️ 4. Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse

| Feature         | Data Warehouse  | Data Lake       | Data Lakehouse  |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Definition**  | Structured storage for analytics | Stores raw data in any format | Combines features of both |
| **Data Type**   | Structured (SQL) | Unstructured & Structured | Structured & Semi-structured |
| **Performance** | Fast but expensive | Cheap but slow | Balanced |
| **Examples**    | Snowflake, Redshift | S3, ADLS | Databricks, Snowflake |

---

## ✅ 5. Best Practices
- **Optimize Performance** – Use caching & partitioning
- **Manage Costs** – Auto-terminate clusters
- **Secure Data** – Implement role-based access & encryption
