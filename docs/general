🚀 Databricks for Data Engineers
---------------------------------

**Data Engineering in Databricks**:
Building, managing, and optimizing data pipelines for large-scale data processing.

---

📌 Why Use Databricks?
- Scalability: Handles massive datasets
- Fast Processing: Optimized Spark engine
- Reliable Storage: Delta Lake
- Automated Workflows: Schedule and monitor ETL jobs

---

🛠️ Key Responsibilities:
1. Ingest Data (APIs, databases, streaming, Datalake)
2. Transform & Process Data (PySpark, SQL)
3. Store Data Efficiently (Delta Lake)
4. Optimize Performance (caching, partitioning)
5. Manage Data Pipelines (workflows, automation)
6. Ensure Data Governance & Security (RBAC, encryption)

🔥 1. What is Databricks?
- Cloud-based platform on Apache Spark
- Supports Python, SQL, Scala, R
- Integrates with AWS, Azure, GCP

---

⚡ 2. Delta Lake – The Smarter Data Lake
- ACID Transactions, Time Travel, Schema Evolution
- Faster queries with indexing & caching

Example SQL:
CREATE TABLE events (event_id STRING, event_type STRING) USING DELTA;

SELECT * FROM events VERSION AS OF 5;

---

🛠️ 3. Querying Data
SQL Example:
SELECT name, age FROM customers WHERE age > 25;

PySpark Example:
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/data/customers")
df.filter(df.age > 25).show()

🏗️ 4. Data Warehouse vs Data Lake vs Data Lakehouse
| Feature      | Warehouse | Data Lake | Lakehouse |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Definition  | Structured storage | Raw data | Hybrid |
| Data Type   | Structured | Any | Structured + Semi |
| Performance | Fast | Slow | Balanced |
| Examples    | Snowflake | S3 | Databricks |

✅ 5. Best Practices
- Optimize Performance (caching, partitioning)
- Manage Costs (auto-terminate clusters)
- Secure Data (RBAC, encryption)
